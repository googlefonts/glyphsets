If you are a font developer or typeface designer, see the [`Lib/glyphsets/encodings/GF Glyph Sets`](https://github.com/googlefonts/glyphsets/tree/main/Lib/glyphsets/encodings/GF%20Glyph%20Sets) subdirectory which provides glyph set definition "standards" that are typically useful sets to draw.

On the other hand, the nam files on the [`Lib/glyphsets/encodings`](https://github.com/googlefonts/glyphsets/tree/main/Lib/glyphsets/encodings) directory are probably more useful for expert web developers. Those files explain how the Unicode Range subsets are defined, typically per script (writing system), in the Google Fonts css API.
