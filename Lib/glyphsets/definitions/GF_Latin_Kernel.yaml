description: "Support ASCII + necessary punctuation and symbols for English language.
  This set is the minimal set required for non-Latin script families that are not
  meant to be used in Latin-language based context. English support is still mandatory
  for technical reasons: application support on one hand, and GF platform display
  on the other hand (to avoid .notdef glyphs appearing everywhere on the website).
  GF encourages designers to also support the `GF Latin Core` glyphset, in addition to any
  script, so native speakers living abroad can also enjoy and use the font wherever
  they are in the world."
